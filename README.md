# Network_Simulator

You will need to write/modify NS2 scripts to evaluate the performance of CSMA/CD and 802.11 protocols.  
Specifically, you need to write/develop NS2 scripts to:

1. Simulate a wired LAN, to study CSMA/CD protocols;
2. Simulate a simple wireless LAN (Ad Hoc mode), to study 802.11 protocols.
